    <h1>Arithmetic Operators</h1>
    <p>In JavaScript, there are several different types of arithmetic operators that can be used to perform mathematical operations on numeric values. These operators include:

        +: The addition operator, which is used to add two numeric values together. For example, 2 + 3 would evaluate to 5.
        -: The subtraction operator, which is used to subtract one numeric value from another. For example, 5 - 3 would evaluate to 2.
        *: The multiplication operator, which is used to multiply two numeric values together. For example, 4 * 5 would evaluate to 20.
        /: The division operator, which is used to divide one numeric value by another. For example, 10 / 5 would evaluate to 2.
        %: The modulo operator, which is used to find the remainder of a division operation. For example, 5 % 2 would evaluate to 1 because 2 goes into 5 evenly two times with a remainder of 1.
        ++: The increment operator, which is used to add 1 to a numeric value. For example, x++ would add 1 to the current value of x.
        --: The decrement operator, which is used to subtract 1 from a numeric value. For example, x-- would subtract 1 from the current value of x.-->
